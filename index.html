<p style="color: white;">The internet is a medium created by human beings that enjoys some independence from the social system. We may as well see it as a collection of all information gathered, or as an “ideology” of humanity’s yearning for freedom. With the rapid advancement of technology, the internet has long been an instrumental part of our peacetime society. It exerts powerful control in all ways and helps to ameliorate the reality. However, when society is in turmoil, we can still intuitively feel the powerlessness of the internet in human society. The advantages that we have been touting turn out to be exaggerated, to become a fatal injury. And the internet freedom we speak of will eventually be built on hard and harsh realities.</p>

<p style="color: white;">Internet under different regimes demonstrate various limits on freedom, and such restrictions exist not only in socialist countries but also in democratic countries. There is no freedom on the Internet under the governance of absolute authority. There are extremely limited information resources, daily news without any negative reports and overwhelmed entertainment media, the monitoring of people’s privacies in the name of security, clearly forbidden speech freedom, etc. While looking at the Internet in democratic countries, monitoring and restrictions have spread continuously to various aspects. The political correctness on social media limited speech freedom to some extent. Numerous personal opinions were deleted, and news that contributed to discrimination and twisting of facts was promoted. All the facts mentioned above have reflected that so-called freedom is just nonsense under different regimes.</p>
